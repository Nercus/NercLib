# NercUtils

NercUtils is a library that provides a set of utilities for several different tasks (check [annotations.lua](https://github.com/Nercus/NercUtils/blob/main/annotations.lua) for more). It is intended for my personal use only. If you want to use it, I will not take any responsibility for any kind of bugs and errors.
